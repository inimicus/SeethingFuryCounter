Track stacks of Grim Focus and its morphs and displays
them in a visual and obvious way.

## Purpose
_But there are already buff trackers that display how many
stacks there are. Why do I need this?_

That's true. Several existing buff trackers already provide
this capability, but how they display this information is less
than ideal. Having a large stack display is more useful and
obvious than a small text counter that can become lost among
other information or is difficult to see, especially if you're
visually impaired.

As one of the nightblade's key class abilities,
successful and timely procs of the spectral bow is crucial
to effective PvE DPS and lining up devastating burst in PvP.

This add-on aims to provide a lightweight and useful option
for those who need a more obvious cue, don't run other buff
trackers, or enjoy filling their screen with flair.

## Functionality
The stack display can be configured to not appear until the first
stack occurs or upon activation of the skill. Each stack will update
the display as they happen and returns to a zero state or disappears
when the buff expires or the proc is used -- depending on selected options.

This add-on is _not_ intended to be a tracker for uptime on
Grim Focus (or its morphs), just for the unique stacking mechanic.

## Implemented Features
- Tracks Grim Focus, Merciless Resolve, Relentless Focus stacks
- Select from different display styles
- Customizable size
- Configurable color overlay for display styles for added customization
- Lock to reticle for styles designed to decorate the crosshairs
- Movable to any place on the screen (and lockable once it's in position)
- Setting to show zero stacks (with supported display styles)
- Option to fade (transparency) of the stack display when the skill needs to be refreshed and still has stacks

## Planned Features
- Additional style variations
- Better colorization options
