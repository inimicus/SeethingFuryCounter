## Purpose
You've heard of Grim Focus Counter, but who cares about nightblades anymore?
Imagine playing a nightblade in 2019. It's all about dragonknights now. And
dragonknights have Seething Fury, provided by slotting Molten Whip, that increases
your next Molten Whip damage by 33% _and_ increases both your Weapon and Spell
damage by 125 for each stack. Impressive!

So here's a counter that tracks those stacks and the duration until they fall off.

## Features
Basic features have been added for simple usability.
- Reposition to anywhere, lock it there if you want
- Change stack count color
- Change duration countdown color
- Add a funky border thing around the duration and maybe make it a spicy color

## Known Issues
No known issues at the moment, so please report any odd behavior you may encounter.

# Enjoy!
